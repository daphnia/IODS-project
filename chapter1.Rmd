# About the project

**This is a very famous course called [Introduction to Open Data Science](https://courses.helsinki.fi/fi/HYMY005/120776718) organised at University of Helsinki in autumn 2017.** My personal repository is [here](https://github.com/daphnia/IODS-project). 

I am working with `r R.version.string` (nickname `r R.version$nickname`) and currently I have RStudio version 1.0.136. I found it helpful to adjust the GUI size a bit larger and change the theme to *Merbivore*: Go to *Tools* > *Global Options* > *Appearance*, and adjust there *Zoom* and *Editor theme*. The R Markdown theme called *journal* is used in this course diary. Command `?html_dependency_bootstrap()` to find the list of themes. The font size had to be adjusted bigger by adding this lines to index.Rmd:  

`<style type="text/css">`  

`body{ /* Normal  */`  
`      font-size: 20px;`  
`  }`  

`</style>`
